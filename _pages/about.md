I enjoy building tools to streamline complex problems, 
engineering and scientific ones alike. 

Starting with programming, I've developed circuit optimization tools, AI (artificial intelligence) board game player, and parallel acceleration of eigenvalue solvers. 

My research in physics constructs computation frameworks where existing methods are tedious. 
I've circumvented complicated integrals in particle collider physics, 
and is currently working on many-particle interactions in topological quantum materials.

While fascinated by the beauty in physics, 
what drives me more has been finding elegant and broadly applicable solutions. 
Bringing my programming experience, I'm focusing back to software engineering to work on real work problems.
