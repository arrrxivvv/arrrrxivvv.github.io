excerpt: 'There has yet to be an operationally meaningful entanglement measure for mixed many-body states. We show that a recently formulated measure, the positive-parital-transpose (PPT) entanglement cost, is equal to negativity for some topological stabilizer models, providing the first operational meaning to their mixed state entanglement measure.

There is yet to be an operationally meaningful entanglement measure for mixed many-body states. We show that a recently formulated measure, the positive-parital-transpose (PPT) entanglement cost, is equal to negativity for some topological stabilizer models, providing the first operational meaning to their mixed state entanglement measure.
