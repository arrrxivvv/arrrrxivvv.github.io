* Utilized CPU multi-threading and GPU CUDA from Pytorch, achieved 8-fold speed up of eigenvalue decompositions on quantum lattice grid points. 
* Built a custom memory management tool to minimize memory allocation time, resulting in an additional 200% overall speed up and 70% reduction in memory consumption.
