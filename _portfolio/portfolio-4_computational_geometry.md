* Led a group of four to design the game algorithm, sped up the decision tree traversal by 100% using alpha-beta pruning and increased the achievable search depth by 50%. 
* Reached the semifinal (top 4) in a contest of 20 AI reversi players. 


* Worked in a group of 4 to implement the sweep-line algorithm to efficiently determine the overlapping area of polygons. 
* Designed data structures storing a list of polygons that allows efficient spatially-ordered traversal.
