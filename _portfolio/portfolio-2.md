* Designed a fast pre-simulation scheme to eliminate 80% costly functional calls to circuit equivalence proof routine. 
* Implemented a command line user interface that accepts keyboard and file commands. 
* Performance achieved top 20 among around 200 contestants in the circuit optimization contest.
