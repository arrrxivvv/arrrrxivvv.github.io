title: "Measuring the Quantum Entanglement by Informational Operation"
excerpt: "Comparing the entanglement in two different quantum states is an important question. In general, quantum states are represented by a density matrix. 
They are big matrices, so such a description, despite being complete, can be unwieldly. 
Thus, we compute, from the density matrices, a single number measure. 
Such measure should faithfully reflect the property while being easy to compute, 
and for mixed-many body states is still elusive. 
We introduce a novel measure for this purpose, which bears meaning from quantum informational operation, that is not reflected in previous methods. "
